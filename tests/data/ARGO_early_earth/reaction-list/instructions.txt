*0* Check to make sure reaction isn't included.

*1* Add the reaction, make sure no tabs, and all the spaces line up perfectly

*2* Make sure to have the 0 entry

*3* Include the Kooij form rate constant. For termolecular reactions, the top entry is k0, bottom entry is kinfty. Make sure to keep the format. No spaces before minus signs.

*4* Check cond_initial.dat file to see if thermochemical data exists for all reactats and products.

*5* Include the right code for the reactions. See Reaction-Guide.txt for guidance. If there are thermochemical data for all the reactions, use a standard code.
